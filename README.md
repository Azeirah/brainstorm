Most importantly is, when going public with this application, that notes can be secured. In the coming time, I'll be working on security and privacy.

Cool project, how can I contribute?

Brainstorm is an open-source project, and that means that it will be partially driven by the community! Even if you're not a great programmer (yet :)), or if you don't have the time for fixing issues, you are welcome to contribute in several ways!

**All kinds of feedback is welcome**. Anyone can contribute to this project in many different ways. If you enjoyed the demo or are maybe already hosting your own brainstorm server, any kind of feedback you may have is very welcome. Any feedback can be left at the [Github issues page](https://github.com/Azeirah/brainstorm/issues).

**If you find any bugs, please take the time to report them**. All bug reports are very welcome. Whenever you do file a bug report, please specify **what you where doing when the bug happened**. For more graphical problems, **always include a picture or a gif/video**.

**Issue discussion**. Discussion on issues is encouraged.

**Documentation is important too**. While feedback, code-contributions and bug-fixes are very important, often proper code-commenting and documentation on building and maintaining the project are left behind.

**Bug fixing and pull requests**. Take a look at the [open issues on Github](https://github.com/Azeirah/brainstorm/issues), there will always be bugs that need fixing and features that need implementing!
